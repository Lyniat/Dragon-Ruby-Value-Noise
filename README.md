# DragonRuby Noise Library
A implementation of different noise functions for Dragon Ruby.
The noise functions work with standard DR but the example needs currently DR *Indie* or *Pro*.
Examples for DR standard are WIP.
If you want to report bugs, have improvements or want in generally talk about this project, visit [the official DragonRuby Discord](http://discord.dragonruby.org) and mention *@lyniat*.

# Performance
While trying to keep things fast, performance isn't the main goal of this project but the ease of use.
If you need some faster noise (and by faster I mean light speed like ðŸ™ƒ), I can totally recommend [Fast Noise Lite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite). (Keep in mind that *Fast Noise Lite* needs you to compile C/C++ code)
